# C-AutoCompiler
I got tired of running the GCC command to include my includeand lib folder and modifying if there were no dlls or .h files. So I made a python script to do it for me. This is an easy method if your new to c and/or dont wanna learn or need cmake for the time being.

How To:

NOTE: gcc compiler is required!
First run the python file. 
You'll be asked your c project directory. Make sure your c project contains a include, lib, and src folder. (If your brand new to c and dont know what gos where, lib holds .a and .dll files, include holds .h, and src holds you c scripts). 
Then type compile and enter :D.

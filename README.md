# C-AutoCompiler
I got tired of running the GCC command to include my include and lib folder and modifying if there were no dlls or .h files. So I made a python script to do it for me. This is an easy method if your new to c and/or dont wanna learn or need cmake for the time being.
Stay tune for update allowing more freedom and allowing more expansive projects 

How To:

NOTE: gcc compiler is required!


First run the python file. You'll be asked your c project directory. Make sure your c project contains a include, lib, and src folder. (If your brand new to c and dont know what gos where, lib holds .a and .dll files, include holds .h, and src holds you c scripts). 
Then type compile and enter. Then go to the project directory and run the a.exe file :D

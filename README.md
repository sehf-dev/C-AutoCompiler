# C-AutoCompiler
C-AutoCompiler is a c language auto compiler thats supposed to make adding librarys and compiling a peace of cake. No CMake required :D!
GCC is currently the only supported compiler but hopefully Clang support hopefully is on the way :O.
My goal is this to be a tool for beginners and advanced C users, so new updates coming soon :D
